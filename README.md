#### Cloud API Interactive Application

Using a browser you can execute any Rackspace API command for any Cloud product without the need to get on a command line or use another CLI tool.

To use the application just login with your username and Cloud Account API key.

The application is divided up by the different cloud products that are available to all customers.
Each call includes the following information:
* Variables needed with descriptions, data types, and what is required
* Endpoint and URI
* Links to the API docs specific section for the call you are needing more information for.

For each API call you will be shown the following information in the browser.
* Request URL
* Request Headers
* Request Object (If data object is used i.e. on Create or Update Statements)
* Response Headers
* Response Body

Warnings are on the calls that do things that could potentially impact an account (creates, updates, deletes, etc.).
